# Text Editor with check.

I often have to check many files or folders, so I needed a tool to do it quickly and conveniently.

## Features

- Select a folder to view its files.
- Display a list of files in the selected folder.
- Open and edit text files.
- Save changes to files: file changes are saved automatically.
- Files and folders that have been checked as verified are kept in memory.

## How to Run
